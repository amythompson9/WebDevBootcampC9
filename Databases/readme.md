##Intro to Databases
* What is a Database
    * A collection of information/data
    * Has an interface - you can write code to interact with it
* SQL(relational) vs NoSQL(non-relational)
    SQL - tabular and flat
        - have to define a table head of time
        - not flexible
    NoSql - don't have to define ahead
          - not tables
          - thing can be nested
          - BSON - binary
